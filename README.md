# brewfiles

This repository contains both my personal and work machine brewfiles for easier setups when fresh installing or setting up a brand new machine.

Below is a list of applications that need to be installed manually:
- [Capture One](https://www.captureone.com/en)
- [Display Link Adapter](https://www.synaptics.com/products/displaylink-graphics/downloads/macos)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Photo Mechanic](https://home.camerabits.com/)
